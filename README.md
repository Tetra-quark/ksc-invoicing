# KSC Invoicing: A PDF Invoice Generator

## Description
A tool for generating PDF invoices.
Keeps track of invoice numbers and generating a new invoice number based a plaintext log file.
Generates PDF invoices from a json configuration file. 

## Why?
When I setup my freelance business - Koppanyi Scientific Consulting - under the French micro-enterprise status, 
I needed to create invoices that were legally compliant. I thought it would be a fun software project to make a tool to 
generate (and eventually manage) my invoices, while also giving them custom design. 

## How to Use

```shell
python generate_invoice_from_json.py invoice_config_file.json

```

## TODO
- [ ] Add GUI

## Installation
